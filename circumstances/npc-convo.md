# This looks familiar...

You pick up the mysterious green rectangle, and you see that its a video game ! Call of Duty MW III. You just bought that same game a little less than a week ago.

### Mysterious wanderer:
**Ah sorry. You didn't have to pick that up for me**

### You:
**No way, you like Call of Duty? I just bought that same game a little while ago!**

### Them
**Yeah, someone told me its a pretty fun game**

### You:
**Well it is a very frustrating game at times I will say haha....**
